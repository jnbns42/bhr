#BrightHR Task

Built with `create-react-app`

Notes:
- This didn't take me as long as git commits would have you believe...Took a break during the day!
- should simply require an `npm install` and `npm run start` to run
- I couldn't decide on writing my own CSS or using Tailwind...opted for Tailwind in the end purely because it was mentioned in job advert
- due to use of Tailwind, I've also used `@craco/craco`, which is required in order to override some create-react-app config
- during set up I had some minor issues with setting tailwind up and inital config files would not generate... Shouldn't be an issue for you, but on the off chance you run into a problem I've included the fully compiled app in `build/`.
- search filter should filter by filename.
- Thrown in mobile navigation as well.
